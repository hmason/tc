tc - Twitter Commander
(a tribute to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander)
======================

=====
About
=====

tc is a command-line twitter client with smart filtering and statistical classification.

Capabilities:
 * whitelists for users whose content you always want to see and prioritize
 * blacklist for users you follow whose content you never want to see
 * blacklist for regular expressions to filter out of your stream entirely
 * topic classification (simple right now, I'm working on this)
 * search
 * the command-line UI rules the skool

Dependencies:

Database:

mongodb - should be running on localhost (it's easy) - http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

Python packages:

pymongo - the python interface to mongo
tweepy - twitter API client
nltk - for simple topic classification and filtering

=======
Install
=======

have to go through the oath authorization process.
